This is a blank slate for the webpack workshop to intoduce newcomers to Webpack.  

We will be covering:

Initializing the project with NPM
Installing webpack and it's dependencies
Refactoring out our .js file with es6
Installing Babel and it's dependencies for webpack so that we may transpile it down to es5
Installing CSS loaders to load our CSS as a webpack module instead of directly including it in our html file so we can include it in our bundle.js
